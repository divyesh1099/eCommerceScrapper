# Web Scraping Project

## Project Overview

This project is a demonstration of web scraping techniques using Python. It's designed for educational purposes to illustrate how to programmatically collect data from web pages. In this example, we scrape data from `example.com`, a placeholder for any publicly accessible website. 

The script is developed to fetch information such as product names, prices, and images from the search results of a hypothetical e-commerce site.

### Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes only. The script is not intended for use on any actual website, especially those with terms of service that prohibit automated data scraping, like Amazon, eBay, etc. Always ensure that you have permission to scrape a website and comply with their terms of service.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### Usage

1. Modify the `TARGET_URL` in the script to point to the page you wish to scrape.
2. Run the script to collect data.
3. Data will be saved in a CSV file in the same directory as the script.

### Example Usage

The script can be executed with a simple command:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

This will start the scraping process, and the results will be stored in a file named `output.csv`.

## Features

- Fetch and parse HTML content from a web page.
- Extract specific data (like product names, images, and prices).
- Save the extracted data into a CSV file format.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome, especially those that improve the efficiency or effectiveness of the scraper.
